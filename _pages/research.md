## Davis Lab Vision and Mission

We believe that computing systems will eventually mediate most human interactions with other humans and the surrounding world.
We therefore seek is to improve the human experience by improving the quality of computing systems.
Three factors are foundational to our success:

1. Our **diverse team** helps us understand the ways that computing systems are used and perceived by many kinds of humans. Computing systems will touch all of humanity, and so all of humanity is needed to develop them.
2. Our **data-driven** approach grounds our work in real-world computing systems, ensuring that our findings and proposals impact the quality of computing systems in the here-and-now, not in the what-might-be.
3. Our **readiness to re-imagine** enables us to propose, design, and implement new paradigms.

### Which computing systems?

There are many ways to answer this question. Here are some of the dimensions that we consider.

#### Time

We consider both existing and future computing systems.

In order to improve the quality of existing computing systems, we take a scientific engineering approach. We empirically study engineering practices in order to drive the development of tools and systems that reflect practitionersâ€™ needs and address their misconceptions. We blend techniques from software engineering, systems, and security in order to understand, measure, and ameliorate the issues that computing practitioners face.

In order to improve the quality of future computing systems, we are interested in:

1. Proposing new paradigms to transform how these systems are designed, built, and deployed.
2. Improving computing education. If future computing professionals are better prepared, they are less likely to make the kinds of errors that lead to bugs and security flaws, and to avoid practices that lead to inequitable computing systems.

#### Domain

- We study *web technologies*, for example input processing tools like regular expressions.
- We study *emerging paradigms*, for example server-side event-driven programming/Node.js and web-friendly query languages/GraphQL).
- In addition, we will soon begin studying scientific computing and other domains as well.

#### Age

We are interested in improving legacy and new systems alike.
