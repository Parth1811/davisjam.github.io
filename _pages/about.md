Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

In my research, I study the engineering of computing systems.
I believe that computing systems will eventually mediate most human interactions with other humans and the surrounding world.
My work improves the human experience by improving the quality of computing systems.
