About me
=====

I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue, in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

As a scientist, I study the engineering of computing systems.
I believe that computing systems will eventually mediate most human interactions with other humans and the surrounding world.
My research improves the human experience by improving the quality of computing systems.
