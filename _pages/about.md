Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

## Professional

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Virginia Tech (2020) under [Dr. Dongyoon Lee](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~dongyoon/).
I also interned at
  Microsoft Research (summer 2019 with [Patrice Godefroid](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pg/))
  and
  IBM Research Almaden (summer 2018 with [Deepavali Bhagwat](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Errs7tgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)).
Before that, I was a software engineer at IBM (2012-2015) working on the [GPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPFS) file system.

You can download my CV [here](/files/professional/JamesDavis-CV.pdf).

## Personal

Some fun facts:

- My wife [Kirsten Davis](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/People) is a faculty member in the department of Engineering Education.
- In 2019 I was Virginia Tech's intramural racquetball champion (singles and doubles).
- I do much of the cooking for my household. I make a mean chili & cornbread.
- I bike to work whenever possible ("nor rain nor snow nor sleet nor hail").
- My pet is fermented.
