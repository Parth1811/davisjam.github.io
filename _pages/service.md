### Software

My lab maintains software that assists in improving software quality.

Here are the tools we currently support:

- [safe-regex](https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex): Check if your regexes are linear-time. The [npm module](https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex) gets 76M downloads/month. The project has 5M dependents amongst GitHub projects.
- [vuln-regex-detector](https://github.com/davisjam/vuln-regex-detector): Ensemble-based approach to check if your regexes are linear-time. Includes variant testing.

### Writings

My lab prepares writeups to summarize our research findings in ways that can benefit the practitioner community.
