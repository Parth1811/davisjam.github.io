### Software

My lab maintains software that assists in improving software quality.

Here are the tools we currently support:

- [safe-regex](https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex): Check if your regexes are linear-time. The [npm module](https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex) gets 40M downloads/month. The project has 5M dependents amongst GitHub projects.
