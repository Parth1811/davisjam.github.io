To get started, please send me an email...but read on!

I receive a lot of email and sometimes things get lost. I have special email filters set up so that I won’t lose your introductory email, but you’ll need to follow these instructions to make it into the proper folder.

If I don’t respond after five business days, feel free to send a follow-up email. But double-check that you followed the instructions! Your email might not have made it into the right folder.

## Minimum requirements

Applicants should have appropriate technical skills, and enough time. Some guidelines:

- **Technical skills**:
 Much of my research involves prototyping and system-building.
 You'll need good fundamentals to make a contribution.
 If you are not yet fluent in any programming language, please take time to develop fluency before you contact me.
- **Time**:
 Research does not happen overnight!
 If you are an undergraduate, know that my most successful undergraduate researchers join the lab early, work often, and stay involved for a long time.
 Contributing meaningfully to the collection of human knowledge (i.e., research) will require you to master cutting-edge knowledge and techniques.

It is not my intention to discourage applicants, but I want you to be ready to be challenged.

## General instructions

I believe that anyone with a will to learn can succeed in research, but to help me understand how you might fit into the team I would like to know:

- Why are you interested in my lab in particular?
- What experience do you have in research? (e.g., teaching yourself new things, reading technical papers)
- What experience do you have in building software? (e.g., internships, projects)
- How much time do you have available to work in my lab (hours/week), and how long do you anticipate doing so? (semesters, years?)
- Which project(s) listed on my website are you interested in? Or something else?

To help me get to know you better, please:

- Attach a resume or CV.
- Point me to something you are proud of. For example, this might be a computing system you built (e.g. an open-source software project you maintain or contributed to), a challenging final project you completed, a research paper you wrote for a class or published, or a piece of craftsmanship (have you built a bookshelf, nurtured a garden, or written poetry?).
- Provide contact information for a person who can comment on your character.
- If possible, provide contact information for a person who can comment on your potential to conduct research. For example, this might be a prior research advisor, or perhaps a teacher who has observed you work independently.

Finally, to match the filter, please include the magic word *xyzzy* somewhere in your email.
