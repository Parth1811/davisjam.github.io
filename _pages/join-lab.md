To get started, please send me an email.

I receive a lot of email and sometimes things get lost. I have special email filters set up so that I won’t lose your introductory email, but you’ll need to follow these instructions to make it into the proper folder.

## General instructions

I believe that anyone with a will to learn can succeed in research, but to help me understand how you might fit into the team I would like to know:

- Why are interested in my lab in particular?
- What experience you have in software development? (e.g., internships, projects)
- What experience you have in research? (e.g., reading technical papers, teaching yourself new things, learning things no one has ever learned before)

To help me get to know you better, please:

- Attach a resume or CV.
- Point me to something relevant that you are proud of. For example, this might be a computing system you built (e.g. an open-source software project you maintain or contributed to), a challenging final project you completed, a research paper you wrote for a class or published, or a piece of craftsmanship (Have you built a bookshelf, nurtured a garden, or written poetry?).
- Provide contact information for a person who can comment on your character.
- [Optional but preferable] Provide contact information for a person who can comment on your potential to conduct research. For example, this might be a prior research advisor, or perhaps a teacher who has observed you work independently.

Finally, to match the filter, please Include the magic word xyzzy somewhere in your email.

If I don’t respond after five business days, feel free to send a follow-up email. But double-check that you followed the instructions! Your email might not have made it into the right folder.
