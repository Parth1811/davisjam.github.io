To get started, please send me an email...but read on!

I receive a lot of email and sometimes things get lost. I have special email filters set up so that I won’t lose your introductory email, but you’ll need to follow these instructions to make it into the proper folder.

If I don’t respond after five business days, feel free to send a follow-up email. But double-check that you followed the instructions! Your email might not have made it into the right folder.

## General instructions

I believe that anyone with a will to learn can succeed in research, but to help me understand how you might fit into the team I would like to know:

- Why are you interested in my lab in particular?
- What experience do you have in research? (e.g., teaching yourself new things, reading technical papers)
- What experience do you have in building software? (e.g., internships, projects)

To help me get to know you better, please:

- Attach a resume or CV.
- Point me to something you are proud of. For example, this might be a computing system you built (e.g. an open-source software project you maintain or contributed to), a challenging final project you completed, a research paper you wrote for a class or published, or a piece of craftsmanship (have you built a bookshelf, nurtured a garden, or written poetry?).
- Provide contact information for a person who can comment on your character.
- If possible, provide contact information for a person who can comment on your potential to conduct research. For example, this might be a prior research advisor, or perhaps a teacher who has observed you work independently.

Finally, to match the filter, please include the magic word *xyzzy* somewhere in your email.
