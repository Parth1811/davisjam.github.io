To get started, please send me an email...but read on!

I receive a lot of email and sometimes things get lost. I have special email filters set up so that I won’t lose your introductory email, but you’ll need to follow these instructions to make it into the proper folder.

If I don’t respond after five business days, feel free to send a follow-up email. But double-check that you followed the instructions! Your email might not have made it into the right folder.

## Minimum requirements

Applicants should have appropriate technical skills, and enough time.
It is not my intention to discourage applicants, but I want you to understand what you are asking for, and to be ready to be challenged.
Some guidelines:

- **Technical skills**:
 I am a software engineering researcher --- I am interested in understanding how to engineer correct and secure software.
 To conduct this kind of research, you need to be a reasonably proficient software engineer.
 This background is necessary in human-subjects research (asking the right questions), in systems analysis research (knowing how to understand a system), and in system-building research (building a reasonable prototype quickly).
 You will need good fundamentals to make a contribution.
 I expect my students to be fluent in several programming languages (e.g. Python, JavaScript, and something in the Java/C++/C family), and to have a reasonable command of modern software engineering techniques (e.g. unit testing, CI, object-oriented programming, software registries, git, GitHub).
 If you are not yet fluent in any programming language, please take time to develop fluency before you contact me.
 As a guideline, if you have written fewer than 5,000 lines of code in a language, you are not yet fluent.
 Not there yet? Practice makes perfect. There are lots of "30 days of code"-type curricula, e.g. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
 For modern SE techniques, I recommend the textbook "Software Engineering at Google" (free e-copy through Purdue library).
 It is well worth $30 and the time spent reading it.
- **Time**:
 Research does not happen overnight!
 As a researcher, you will need to join the lab early in your degree, work often, and stay involved for several semesters.
 Contributing meaningfully to the collection of human knowledge (i.e., research) will require you to master cutting-edge knowledge and techniques.
 I expect graduate research assistants to commit to 20+ hours/week.
 I expect undergraduate research assistants to work for 10-20 hours/week, with peaks and valleys tied to exams and projects.

## General instructions

I believe that anyone with a will to learn can succeed in research, but to help me understand how you might fit into the team I would like to know:

- Why are you interested in my lab in particular?
- What experience do you have in research? (e.g., teaching yourself new things, reading technical papers)
- What experience do you have in building software? (e.g., internships, projects). (Have you worked professionally? Have you compiled the Linux kernel? Do you have an Android app to demonstrate? Have you read the Node.js source code? Have you contributed to an open-source project? Are you skilled in using a machine learning framework?)
- How much time do you have available to work in my lab (hours/week), and how long do you anticipate doing so? (semesters, years?)
- Which project(s) listed on my website are you interested in? Or something else?

To help me get to know you better, please:

- Attach a resume or CV.
- Attach 1-3 relevant and representative projects (e.g. open-source code), reports, or publications, and explain your role in the project. These should demonstrate your potential to conduct research in my lab. If you do not have anything along these lines, your email should explain why you think you are prepared to engage in research.

Finally, to match my email filter, please include the magic word *xyzzy* somewhere in your email.

### Graduate students

If you are a *current* or *incoming* Purdue graduate student in the ECE department, send me the email described above, with the subject "*Prospective assistant: graduate (current)*".

If you are *applying* to Purdue’s ECE department for graduate work, send me the email described above, with the subject "*Prospective assistant: graduate (applicant)*".

### Undergraduate students

If you are a current Purdue undergraduate in the ECE department, send me the email described above, with the subject "*Prospective assistant: undergraduate*".

## Onboarding

If I like the looks of your application, I will probably ask you to work on something small for 4-6 weeks to get a sense of your commitment, interests, and skill set.
Then we can discuss a longer-term relationship.
