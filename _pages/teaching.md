# Philosophy

I strive to build my students' expertise and critical thought.
If you take one of my courses, you will learn to ask and answer not only "*What?*" and "*How?*" but also "*Why?*" and "*How else?*".

My courses involve lengthy, often-team-based projects.
This approach is supported by educational research, e.g. problem-based learning (PBL).

# Offerings

At the undergraduate level, I primarily teach the Software Engineering course, known variously as ECE 461 and ECE 30861 ([link](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Academics/Undergraduates/UGO/CourseInfo/courseInfo/AboutUs?courseid=402&show=true&type=undergrad)).

At the graduate level, I teach Advanced Software Engineering, currently known as ECE 595 ([link](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Academics/Online/Courses/advanced-software-engineering)).
