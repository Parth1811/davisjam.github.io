**I am recruiting *graduate* and *undergraduate* students (esp. PhD). See [lab page](research/) for details.**

Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

I lead the [Duality Lab](/research).
In our research, we study the engineering of complex computing systems.
**We improve the human experience by improving the quality of complex computing systems**.
Our primary interests are in the *safety* and *security* of software-centric systems, achieved in part through effective *engineering processes*.

Use the links at the top to learn more about my activities.
