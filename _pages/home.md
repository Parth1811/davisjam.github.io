**I am recruiting *graduate* and *undergraduate* research assistants (esp. PhD). See [lab page](research/) for details.**

Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

I lead the [Duality Lab](/research).
We study the engineering of software-intensive computing systems, writ broad.
Our primary interests are in safety (e.g. correct and usable) and security, achieved in part through effective engineering processes.
We apply a "dual" socio-technical philosophy &mdash; high-quality systems must be engineered using both human and technical perspectives.
We are empiricists; we strive to measure the practical impact of problems and solutions.

Our work is typically published in software engineering (ICSE, FSE, ASE) and cybersecurity (S&P, USENIX) conferences.

Use the links at the top to learn more about our activities.
