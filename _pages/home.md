Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

I lead the [Duality Lab](/research).
In our research, we study the engineering of computing systems.
We improve the human experience by improving the quality of computing systems.
Our primary interests are in software *correctness*, *security*, and *usability*.

Use the links at the top to learn more about my activities.
