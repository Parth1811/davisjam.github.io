# Lab overview

Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the Elmore Family School (department) of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

I lead the [Duality Lab](/research).
We study the engineering of software-intensive computing systems.
We are specifically interested in how software-intensive systems *fail* and how these failure modes can be mitigated.
- We apply a "dual" socio-technical philosophy &mdash; high-quality systems must be engineered using both human and technical perspectives, and analysis of failures and mitigations must consider the engineered product as well as the underlying engineering process.
- We are *empiricists*; we strive to measure the practical impact of problems and solutions.

Our research is typically published in software engineering (ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE) and cybersecurity (S&P, USENIX) conferences.

Several organizations support our research, including the US National Science Foundation, Google, Cisco, and Rolls Royce.

Use the links at the top to learn more about our activities.
