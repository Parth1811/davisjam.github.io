**I am recruiting *graduate* and *undergraduate* research assistants (esp. PhD). See [lab page](research/) for details.**

Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the Elmore Family School (department) of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

I lead the [Duality Lab](/research).
We study the engineering of software-intensive computing systems.
We are specifically interested in how software-intensive systems *fail* and how these failure modes can be mitigated.
We apply a "dual" socio-technical philosophy &mdash; high-quality systems must be engineered using both human and technical perspectives, and analysis of failures and mitigations must consider the engineered product as well as the underlying engineering process.
We are *empiricists*; we strive to measure the practical impact of problems and solutions.

Our work is typically published in software engineering (ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE) and cybersecurity (S&P, USENIX) conferences.

Several organizations support our research, including the National Science Foundation, Google, Cisco, and Rolls Royce.

Use the links at the top to learn more about our activities.
