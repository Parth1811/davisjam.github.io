**I am recruiting PhD students starting in Fall 2020. See [lab page](research/) for details.**

Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

In my research, I study the engineering of computing systems.
I believe that computing systems will eventually mediate most human interactions with other humans and the surrounding world.
My work improves the human experience by improving the quality of computing systems.

Use the links at the top to learn more about my activities.
